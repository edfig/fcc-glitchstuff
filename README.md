Free Code Camp Stuff by edfig
=========================

This started out as my collection of Free Code Camp assignments.

Hope this helps someone.

**Peace**,

Also, I made this using Glitch. That was fun. Find out more [about Glitch](https://glitch.com/about).

Mongodb
------------
Start Mongodb with mongod --port 27017 --dbpath=./data --nojournal 

(Do I really need to do this? How does it start automatically? Must learn.)

Timestamp Microservice
------------

- Home page points to views/index.html
- Home page provides instructions for the API
- Home page uses the word "normietime"

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- I created a module exports (I don't know what it's really called yet) `timestuff.js` 
--I'm still not certain about when I should use camelCase...should timestuff be timeStuff? If yes, then why?
