Hope this helps someone.

Also, I made this using Glitch. It is fun. Find out more [about Glitch](https://glitch.com/about).

General
------------
- Home page points to views/index.html
On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- I created a module exports (I don't know what it's really called yet) `timestuff.js` 
--I'm still not certain about when I should use camelCase...should timestuff be timeStuff? If yes, then why?

Mongodb
------------
I'm using mlabs to host my Mongo database

Timestamp Microservice
------------
- Home page provides instructions for the API
- Home page uses the word "normietime"
